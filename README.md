    ON THE GO SCRIPT PROTOTYPES IN DISCORD
</div>

## What is discterpreter?
Discterpreter is an MoonScript interpreter written in Python that can be used to quickly prototype scripts on the go using Discord.

## How do I use Discterpreter?
Using discterpreter is simple! first read up on the [MoonScript]() reference guide to understand the fundamentals of the language. Then while in a server that Disterpreter is a part of. Use the command **!drun ``` code to run here ```**

Discterpreter will automatically display the output of your program to console!

## Why did I make Discterpreter?
When I began working on interpreters I wanted to find a way to implement my own custom programming/language interpreter in a new and fun way. While there already are many *great* discord interpreters for languages such as Python. This was purely an educational experience for me and a passion project.

## How can I help?
In the nature of open source, I'll always read and respond to issues/pull requests. However, this is mainly a project I am working on alone. It's quite impossible to turn down a solid pull request. If you have any ideas please feel free to submit a pull request (no specific format needed) and I'll review it as soon as possible.

Other than that, feed back is really appreciated. Use the command **!feedback** and Discterpreter will provide you a link to the webpage that allows  you to leave me some feedback. Alternatively, you can message me via discord and I'll get to you as soon as possible! Drey#5314
